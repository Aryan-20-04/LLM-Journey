ðŸ”¹ Project Summary: Binary Classification with Neural Network on Moons Dataset

This project trains a simple feedforward neural network to classify the two classes of the make_moons dataset (a common toy dataset for testing nonlinear classifiers).

1. Data Preparation

Used make_moons from scikit-learn with n_samples=1000 and noise=0.2.

Converted dataset into PyTorch tensors.

Split data into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.

2. Model Architecture (ImpModel)

Input Layer: 2 features (x, y coordinates).

Hidden Layer 1: 32 neurons, ReLU activation.

Hidden Layer 2: 16 neurons, ReLU activation.

Output Layer: 1 neuron (logit for binary classification).

3. Training Setup

Loss Function: BCEWithLogitsLoss (binary cross-entropy with built-in sigmoid).

Optimizer: Adam, learning rate = 0.01.

Epochs: 1000.

Printed training loss every 100 epochs.

4. Training Process

Forward pass â†’ Loss calculation â†’ Backpropagation â†’ Parameter update.

Loss decreases over time, indicating learning.

5. Testing & Evaluation

On the test set, predictions were made using torch.sigmoid followed by a 0.5 threshold.

Accuracy was calculated by comparing predictions with true labels.

Final Accuracy: ~90â€“95% (depends on run/seed).
