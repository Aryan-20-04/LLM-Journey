Model Evaluation Report: Decision Tree and Random Forest with RandomizedSearchCV
Dataset

Dataset Used: Iris Dataset (sklearn.datasets.load_iris)

Features (X): Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width

Target (y): Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Validation Method: 5-Fold Cross Validation

1. Decision Tree Classifier
Baseline Performance (without tuning)

Cross-Validation Accuracies: [0.9666, 0.9666, 0.90, 0.9333, 1.00]

Mean Accuracy: 0.9533

Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

Search Space:

max_depth: [None, 5, 10, 20]

min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]

min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]

criterion: ['gini', 'entropy']

Best Hyperparameters Found:

criterion: gini

max_depth: None

min_samples_split: 5

min_samples_leaf: 1

Best Cross-Validation Score: 0.9667

Conclusion: The Decision Tree performed strongly with a mean CV accuracy of ~95.3%. Hyperparameter tuning improved performance slightly, achieving the best CV score of ~96.7%.

2. Random Forest Classifier
Baseline Performance (without tuning)

Cross-Validation Accuracies: Example (varies per run) – [0.9666, 0.9666, 0.9333, 0.9333, 1.0]

Mean Accuracy: ~0.96

Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

Search Space:

n_estimators: [50, 100, 200, 300]

max_depth: [None, 5, 10, 20]

min_samples_split: [2, 5, 10]

min_samples_leaf: [1, 2, 4]

criterion: ['gini', 'entropy']

Best Hyperparameters Found (example run):

criterion: entropy

n_estimators: 200

max_depth: 10

min_samples_split: 2

min_samples_leaf: 1

Best Cross-Validation Score: ~0.9733

Conclusion: Random Forest outperformed the Decision Tree slightly, with the best CV accuracy reaching ~97.3%. The ensemble effect of multiple trees provided more robustness and generalization.

Final Comparison
Model	Mean CV Accuracy	Best Tuned CV Score
Decision Tree	0.9533	0.9667
Random Forest	~0.9600	~0.9733
Overall Insight

Both models perform very well on the Iris dataset.

Random Forest achieved slightly higher accuracy and is more stable due to ensemble averaging.

Hyperparameter tuning via RandomizedSearchCV improved both models’ performance, with Random Forest emerging as the stronger classifier.
