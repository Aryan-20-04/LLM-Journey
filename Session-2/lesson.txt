Summary of the Code

Model Definition

A custom class LinearReg is defined, inheriting from nn.Module.

It contains a single linear layer (nn.Linear(2,1)) to map 2D input → 1D output.

The forward pass applies a sigmoid activation to output probabilities (since it’s a binary classification problem).

Dataset

Input features X are manually defined as 2D points.

Labels Y are defined as 0 (below line) or 1 (on/above line).

Training Setup

Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss).

Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Training Loop

Runs for multiple epochs.

Each iteration:

Forward pass → compute predictions.

Compute loss against ground truth labels.

Backpropagation → compute gradients.

Optimizer step → update weights.

Prediction

After training, the model is tested on a new input (e.g., [5.0, 7.0]).

It outputs a probability (close to 0 or 1), which can be interpreted as class label.
